Description: 
    This package provides a dataset consisting of all winners of the
    PECASE award from 1996-2017. PECASE is awarded through the US government
    to promising early-stage scientists and engineers, who are nominated
    by participating federal agencies (e.g. Dept of Health and Human
    Services). Ideas about how to use this dataset including combining
    with NIH reporter data to assess the success of PECASE award recipients.
